ApRES Terminology and Definitions
*common terminology helpful for understanding and interpretting ApRES data

ApRES: Autonomous phase-sensitive Radio Echo Sounder is a frequency modulated continuous waveform (FMCW) system that smoothly ramps (increases) 
       emitted frequencies from 200 MHz to 400 MHz over a 1 second time interval

chirp: 1 second pulse going from 200 MHz to 400 MHz (also referred to as a subburst, trace)
burst: cluster of multiple chirps recorded one after another at a specified time. Run time for 1 burst of 100 chirps is 100 seconds (each chirp 
       is 1 second * 100 chirps)
